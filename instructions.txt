COMPILATION INSTRUCTIONS:
- Open Xcode project file
- Go to Product > Scheme > Edit Scheme > Run > Options
- Set working directory to be your own computer's path to the HW4 folder (the folder that is in the SAME directory as the .xcodeproj file, not the parent HW4 folder)
- Run code from there

- If you have an older Mac, Xcode might give error saying to set deployment type to older version, follow those instructions if error occurs

If you want to set the command line argument to a different scene:
- Product > Scheme > Edit Scheme > Run > Arguments
- From there, set your argument file (scene1.test for example)
